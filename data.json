Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell with “Connect-ExchangeOnline”, then run the following command to retrieve audit logs specific to this scenario:\n$AuditLog = Search-UnifiedAuditLog -Operations \"Update group\" -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000.\n\n2. Filter logs matching the issue to gather affected group info by running the following two commands:\n\n$GroupID = $AuditLog | % {ConvertFrom-Json $_.AuditData} | ? {($_.Actor -match \"Group Configuration Processor\") -and ($_.ModifiedProperties -match \"SecurityEnabled\")} | % {$_.ObjectId -replace \"^.*Group_\", \"\"}\n \n$GroupID | Get-UnifiedGroup -ResultSize Unlimited\n \n3.
