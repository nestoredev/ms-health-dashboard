Due to the complexity of their interaction, a code-level resolution is required to ensure that impact is fully alleviated. We're working to develop this solution and will provide updates as its development progresses.\n\nScope of impact: Users attempting to use the “Promote to Viva Engage” feature through a SharePoint Page may encounter errors in their endeavor to do so.\n\nRoot cause: A conflict resulting from two SharePoint web parts which render on the same page, is resulting in impact.\n\nNext update by: Wednesday, July 2, 2025, at 2:00 AM UTC"
