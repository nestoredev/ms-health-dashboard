Follow the link to the Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics V15 App: https://app.powerbi.com/Redirect?action=InstallApp&appId=5954cb3f-35a2-494c-a7af-adbb9229069f&packageKey=11c1513a-ba16-45c9-9077-cc5f79a6c9d8eReAKIjns3tbhr-POllSDcCeCtjCengXhfHpQMMFJmY&ownerId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47&buildVersion=15\n2. Install the app using the desired method.\n(Use \"Update the workspace and the app\" option to overwrite the broken version, or use  \"Install another copy\" if you would like to keep a copy)\n3. Once the app is installed, go to the workspace. It will show sample data at first load. Select \"Connect your data\" from the yellow banner to connect your tenant's data.\n4. Enter your tenant ID, select Next\n5. Ensure that Authentication Method is set to \"OAuth2\", then Sign In and Connect.\n6. Sign in with your admin/report reader credentials.\n7. Report data will refresh and the report will update automatically.\n \nFinal status: The validation process for the fix completed, and we've deployed the fix within the most recent app version of Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics. We've tested with a subset of affected admins to ensure the impact has been remediated with our fix implemented, and admins need to take the actions outlined in the More Info section of this communication to update their app version and receive the fix.\n \nScope of impact: Any admin accessing Microsoft 365 Usage Analytics reports in Power BI may have been affected.\n \nStart time: Thursday, January 1, 2026, at 12:00 AM UTC\n \nEnd time: Friday, February 13, 2026, at 5:25 PM UTC\n \nRoot cause: A subset of Power BI logic didn't have the expected date formatting required for the year 2026, resulting in impact.\n \nNext steps: \n- We're reviewing the impacting Power BI logic to determine how the incorrect date formatting wasn't identified prior to being introduced into the service. The results of this investigation will help us to improve our pre-deployment processes and ensure similar instances of impact don't occur in the future.\n \nThis is the final update for the event."
